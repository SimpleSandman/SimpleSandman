# Hello! I'm Simple Sandman! üëã
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Coder by day, gamer by night");
```

My real name is [Kenton Standard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kentonstandard/), but my online handle is Simple Sandman. On my personal time if I am not gaming or streaming on Twitch, I am a .NET developer with various side projects. I have to say, C# has been a dream for me to write in. I have always been fascinated with the C++ syntax, but the versatility and ease of maintenance C# brings has been nothing less than fun! 

## Current Personal Projects
I am building a [Twitch Chat Bot](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/TwitchBot) for my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/simple_sandman). This allows me to stream my favorite games knowing my partner-in-crime has my back! It is always awesome to tell people that I have written this from scratch while shooting bad guys or jumping over obstacles because it gives me a chance to tell them one of my biggest passions.

I also have a [community API](https://www.tracenacademy.com/index.html) that is [open-source](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/UmaMusumeAPI) for a mobile anime game called, [Uma Musume: Pretty Derby](https://umamusume.jp/). I even have a [loader app](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/UmaMusumeLoadSqlData) to help reload data into either a SQL Server database or MySQL/MariaDB.

Here I have a [.NET CLI implementation](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/UmaMusumeToolbox) of [rockisch's umamusu-utils](https://github.com/rockisch/umamusu-utils) script for [Uma Musume: Pretty Derby](https://umamusume.jp/). This allows you to download the assets from the game's meta file via `.exe` and `appsettings.json`.

## Past Personal Projects
I have built my first Visual Studio Extension called, [Json Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KentonStandard.JsonFormatter) that will minify or prettify your JSON file inside your code window. This is compatibile with Visual Studio 2017/2019/2022. This is [open-source](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/JsonFormatter) if you want to contribute to the extension.

I have a library called, [Fate/Grand Calculator](https://github.com/SimpleSandman/FateGrandCalculator). This is based on the mobile anime game, [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us/) (which is built in Unity 2018) and that will help figure out combat calculations. This will be used for my upcoming [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui) app which will simulate node combat and help manage your personal Chaldea because let's be real here, who wants to input their servants and CEs over and over again? üòè

## Past Major Contributions
When I was playing on a popular Red Dead Redemption 2 role-playing server, I wanted to contribute to the back-end. I have provided some code snippets to various C# projects inside [VORP](https://github.com/VORPCORE). Though my biggest contribution was the rework of the entire project, [VORP Housing](https://github.com/VORPCORE/VORP-Housing). When I first cloned the project, it would not even compile. So after just getting it up and going again, I had to personally rework all of the code that was not up to .NET and VORP standards. Not only the housing resource got a major upgrade (from 0.45 ms to 0.09 ms), I was able to add further stability and enhancements for both users (server owner/player) and developers.
